<div>One of the things we talk about all the time at L’Oréal is the power of connection and collaboration and how important they are in sparking innovation and creativity. But connection and collaboration don’t just happen. They require you to build relationships and establish trust, and that requires empathetic leadership. Empathetic leadership can be defined […]</div>

<div>Is there an actual or perceived dichotomy between intent and outcome within our recent history?

<div>There’s only 11,316 women in the U.S. that hold Private Pilot certificates. Nearly a decade ago, I decided I was brave (crazy) enough to be one of those women.
