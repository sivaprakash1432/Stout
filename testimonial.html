        <p class ="sem"id="scroll-text" style="text-align: center; margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;margin-top: 5%;">"I recently worked with Marvelyn and her team and found them to be efficient yet highly personal. Having just returned from abroad, Stout was the first recruiter I contacted and the team got back to me immediately, met with me to understand my needs and capabilities, and arranged an interview within the week. We stormed through the five stages and received the offer within two weeks. I attribute the swift success to their commitment to candidate-company-fit, and the strong/personalized relationship they build with their clients and candidates over time. They continue to follow up with me until today, and I thoroughly enjoy the interaction! I recommend them without hesitation - Stout is an exemplary representation of the impeccable North American efficiency and service!"</p>

I never had one 'just okay' interaction with them. They always went above and beyond my expectations and I was never wondering where we were in the process. They only recommended me for the job that I landed. They didn't try to place me with a company to make a buck. They made sure that they would be a good fit for my needs and I would be a good fit for them."</p>

I can't say enough great things about them."</p>

In a CPG industry filled with a number of recruiters and search firms that are task-centric, the Stout difference is clear; they are passionate about placing you in the culture, community and path that best suites YOU. Relationships are at the center of Stout's work. Your goals become their goals. Your passion becomes their passion. I highly recommend this team and believe my experience with them has helped shape a brighter future for me." </p>
